# NEAR Hispano: Fostering Web3 Adoption Through Education

[NEAR Hispano](https://nearhispano.org/) is an educational community whose mission is to introduce NEAR Protocol in Spanish-speaking countries. Started in May 2021, NEAR Hispano distinguished itself for its educational programs and successful outreach campaigns, which brought over 600 developers from Latin American Countries into the NEAR ecosystem. In this section, we are going to provide an introduction to NEAR Hispano by introducing its mission and vision, how the idea of creating a NEAR regional hub for educating and onboarding developers came about, and its business model.

NEAR Hispano is a regional hub that provides education and mentorship to local entrepreneurs,  developers, and educators in Spanish speaking communities. By providing guidance in the local language, NEAR Hispano is able to open up new opportunities for economic development and innovation in communities with high human capital potential.

NEAR Hispano’s leader, [Claudio Cossio](https://medium.com/@ows-team/humans-of-the-open-web-sandbox-claudio-cossio-the-rise-of-a-pionear-guild-leader-67c7b314cc18), is a Mexican entrepreneur who has experienced first-hand the benefits of Web3 and the potential of the NEAR blockchain. Claudio has launched [Metapool](https://metapool.app/), one of the most successful and profitable dApps on the NEAR ecosystem. Having such great success and being aware of the life changing opportunities that the NEAR Protocol offers, Claudio dedicated his efforts to help more people get access to it as well. By setting up a team of entrepreneurs, developers, and educators from Latin American Countries (LATAM) that share the same objectives, Claudio was able to create a thriving educational business.

The NEAR Hispano team is  committed to making Web3 accessible in LATAM by eliminating the language barrier–the biggest obstacle faced by developers and entrepreneurs in LATAM. As several NEAR Hispano team members pointed out: “English is a wall that prevents us from getting involved with this new technology” (Cristian). By making educational courses and the necessary resources available in Spanish, NEAR Hispano is able to bring Web3 and the possibilities that come with it to Spanish-speaking people.

> “You are told that if you want to join the club only  English is accepted. Like this you miss the opportunity to be developing what you want to. Blockchain is not an easy subject to learn, by having educational material and training opportunities in English you put an additional obstacle on people who want to know more. The first one is that they have to learn about blockchain, and the second one is that they have to learn English. This way  you are cutting off opportunities, there is no reason for that barrier to exist.”

Being able to reach non-English speaking developers and entrepreneurs is essential for fostering
Web3 adoption, the spread of NEAR blockchain, and the creation of a truly inclusive open Web. NEAR Hispano identified this pressing need and by understanding the challenges of local communities was able to put forward an effective plan of action to bring NEAR into LATAM and all Spanish speaking countries.

> “When we started our first and foremost mission was to educate Spanish speaking community in any Spanish region in the world to understand what Near Protocol is all about, and more importantly what are the benefits of knowing what a blockchain is and what decentralized autonomous organizations or DAOs mean, and how this new change of paradigm is gonna be the next five to ten years, what's gonna be pushing the envelope in anything related to technology and more importantly just personal finance I reckon.”

Education is key for attracting more people to Web3 as it helps raise awareness of the concrete opportunities. As Web3 remains largely unknown to the general public, there are still many prejudices attached to blockchain and crypto. Only through education can people's perspectives be changed and horizons broadened, and  this is what NEAR Hispano is all about–broadening perspectives and creating opportunities.
