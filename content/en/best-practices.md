# Best Practices for Building a Web3 Educational Business
Through in-depth interviews with NEAR Hispano’s leaders and educators, we were able to identify nine key principles for building a successful educational community.  These nine principles are:

1. Determine the values of your community
2. Choose a simple and flexible business structure
3. Reach out to the NEAR community and Create Synergies
4. Lay the foundation of your initiative with people you trust
5. Offer something that the community wants
6. Create different entry points
7. Provide mentorship
8. Listen to the community and implement feedback
9. Learn to accept failure and try out different routes

In this section, we will provide an overview of what we think are the crucial steps for building a thriving business based on the strong community and explain how these can be carried out in different contexts.

# Nine Principles for Building a Thriving Educational Business

## 1. Determine the Values of Your Community

It is your job as an entrepreneur to determine what your organizational values are and make sure your whole enterprise is radiating them to the customer. And this is different from the features of the amazing teaching course you are building. The high quality of your teaching course is critical, however, you also need people to feel they associate with your programme. You need to make sure they stand behind your way of doing business. This means that on top of liking your courses or the “what”, they need to support the procedures or the  “how” and the “why” of your enterprise. You need them to agree and relate with your philosophy of doing things. Only then will they bring friends and family to build a tight and harmonious community.

Today everyone in NEAR Hispano is extremely proud of their community being empathetic. NEAR Hispano's business case clearly demonstrated that it could not succeed in building an educational community in such a niche industry as crypto without understanding, and truly recognizing the problems people have specifically in their region. Because crypto is  a field that is still ridden by prejudices, you need to know what students' circumstances are.  Whether it is a lack of technological savviness or a fear to get scammed, or anything else, you need to care about it as if it is your own struggle. Essentially, you need empathy.  As Manuel says:

![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Tp2PgZzMEw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Tp2PgZzMEw)

> “The things that we at NEAR Hispano work on are based on seeking empathy and attracting everyone to get involved in NEAR Hispano and work voluntarily, but looking for a benefit.
And I'm not talking about economic benefits, I'm talking about professional, technical, and personal gain. So it is about looking for that empathy in NEAR Hispano”

According to the NEAR Hispano’s team, their success was largely dependent on the fact that they understood the pain points of their region and started to get on board early.

> “..And in this way, we have achieved that some universities, for example, have already worked on formalizing specializations in their computer systems or blockchain-based computing careers. But the interesting thing is that we managed to do it with the NEAR Protocol. So that is an excellent achievement because we are discovering empathy. We have found that universities find some benefit and value for their students in everything NEAR Hispano has done.”

Understanding the nature of people’s attitude towards blockchain and starting to see the situation from the perspective of the newcomer is something you cannot ignore in Web3. When community members feel their concerns are heard and addressed, they are less likely to leave and are more likely to develop trust in your team.  As a payback, they will be more passionate about the success of your business and they will share their thoughts on how to improve. They will give your feedback -  the most valuable asset. Manuel remarks:

> “I think that we have been building a community… The vision and the need for people to collaborate, to work as a team, to feel in an environment of more trust, to be able to share.”

Empathy is just one way to create a safe space in the community around your educational programme. We are sure there is more. The question here is “What will make people proud when they join my community?” Is that the region they belong to? Do they feel proud because your service allows them to do good for their specific age-group? Profession? Hobby? Try to define that early and emphasize that whenever you can. New members should not be guessing this on their own - it must  strike them in the face when they join. Hand these fulfilling values to them on a silver plate.

Whatever you choose as your guiding principles, your business value, it is not enough to put it on the website and forget about it. The goal is to align your values with every single activity executed by the enterprise so make sure that these identified values are living through your business.

## 2. Choose a Simple and Flexible Business Structure
Selecting a business structure is one of the most important decisions you will have to make. The business structure you choose will influence everything from day-to-day operations, to taxes, and will ensure the smooth continuation of your business. When making your own considerations  you should keep in mind that a simpler and flexible structure will help you spend your energies on your work. A way to keep it simple is to standardize processes when it comes to taxes, time invested in the project, and all other aspects related to organization.
Since you want your business to scale, you need to make sure your structure helps you achieve this goal instead of hindering you. It is also important that once you choose your structure you remain open to feedback on how to improve and carry out the changes needed depending on the arising needs.

## 3. Reach Out to the NEAR Community and Create Synergies
NEAR has a thriving and very engaged community with outstanding individuals ready to give you advice and support. Being engrained in this community is going to help you access the knowledge and tools you need to kickstart your project.

> “We are all humans so at the end of the day I’ve been pretty lucky to surround myself with really outstanding individuals and also have the opportunity to work with outstanding individuals in the Near ecosystem as well. I think that's the key part right. Open Web Sandbox is the perfect example, if it wasn't for you or the 4nts Guild, Near Hispano wouldn't be, that's the reality of it right, I need to give props or props are due, in having a support network I think it’s imperative.”
>
> Claudio


There are many like-minded people that might be trying to achieve the same goal as you or that might be interested in helping you out. Reaching out to those people, sharing your doubts and struggles, receiving their opinions and support will be of invaluable help. As your ultimate goal will be that of educating entrepreneurs and developers, and onboarding them  onto the NEAR ecosystem, being involved with the community will enable you to stay up to date with the opportunities and initiatives that might help your students get involved at a deeper level.

## 4. Lay the Foundation of Your Initiative with People You Trust
Many entrepreneurs wonder where to find their dream team when starting their journey. Essentially, you can find your team everywhere. You can meet people in the most random places but you can also start with those nearest and dearest to you. Your friends and family. A crucial privilege that you gain by starting your journey with them is trust. Having someone you can trust and confide in their capabilities and commitment can be incredibly helpful in the first stages of your project. When you can rely on your team members, the workflow can run more smoothly, and precious time and resources can be saved. Responsibilities can be delegated and team members can run their tasks independently without the need of being double-checked.

> “I am the one who kickstarted everything but I need to give props where props are due - Cristian and Alan. Also Manuel. They were the ones pushing the limits on how you can engage people and they already had  a very good network of teachers, researchers. And for me just enabling these connections to happen…At the end, it is all a bet that the team is going to execute on the technology and the roadmap.”
>
> Claudio

 The core team of NEAR Hispano is essentially a group of friends that was brought together by one motivated individual with a noble vision.  He talked to his friends and invited his amazing mother to join the team because of her PhD background in education. This is not something uncommon in the NEAR ecosystem. Outstanding individuals bring into the ecosystem more outstanding individuals they trust thus creating an efficient network of people that are not only driven by rewards but by care for their communities.


## 5. Offer Something That the Community Wants

![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9yx_4BTtzA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9yx_4BTtzA)

People are driven by different motivations and shaped by their background and experiences. In order to make your program as inclusive and attractive as possible, it is then fundamental to keep this in mind and try to meet people where they are at. Pay attention to the context in which you are going to start your educational program and ask yourself the following questions: How can my initiative bring value to this community? What might prevent people from enrolling into this course? What do people need in order to feel motivated enough to participate?
Answering these questions will enable you to adjust your approach based on the circumstances and make your program more appealing. Understanding where people are coming from, their needs, their values, their ambitions, will allow you to effectively communicate to your target audience how your training program is going to help them achieve their goals.

## 6. Create Different Entry Points
When you are trying to attract people to Web3, having different entry points is essential. Newcomers might have very diverse backgrounds and experiences;  making sure that there are different educational paths that they can undertake will make your initiative more attractive and therefore effective.

The courses created by NEAR Hispano are made to have a broad appeal and to introduce people into the different opportunities that the NEAR ecosystem offers. The idea behind this approach is that people are going to be more motivated to complete the course if they can choose the path that fits best with their background,  interests and ambition:

![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP2rnY7Cbk0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP2rnY7Cbk0)

> “For example, if the participant is a developer, we have the Near Certified Analyst in Spanish, where people enroll in the blockchain technologies in NEAR. In parallel to that we have the Near Certified Developers, where you can grow your development skills, and the NEAR Certified Professor program for those that would like to start teaching. Additionally, if you are a university professor you can bring NEAR technologies into the classroom.”
>
> Cristian

Allowing people to learn about the NEAR ecosystem from the angle that is most interesting to them, or they are most familiar with, is going to ensure a better outcome and increase engagement. It is therefore important to recognize what people’s needs and interests are to create a path for personal fulfillment through NEAR.


## 7. Provide Mentorship
Navigating Web3 presents many challenges for newcomers who have to grapple with learning new concepts in a continuously evolving and  fast-paced environment. Those unfamiliar with the space might easily feel overwhelmed by both the amount of information and the speed to which they travel. In such an environment, mentorship is crucial to ensure that newcomers do not feel discouraged. Being able to ask questions and talk about one's struggles keeps people on track with the program and gives them the confidence they need to cross the finish line.

![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTJ0zXy1Zho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTJ0zXy1Zho)

> “You are not left alone. You do not do the course alone, but there is feedback. This is what we propose in this accompaniment process.”
>
> Luz

NEAR Hispano set up a structure according to which instructors are available every day of the week for one hour daily sessions to clarify doubts and questions. Following people closely allows them to feel supported and reduces the likelihood of dropouts. Depending on the group you are working with, you might decide to allocate more or less hours to mentorship, however, providing availability for discussion and feedback is a must for keeping people engaged and motivated.

## 8. Listen to the Community and Implement Feedback
It is important to take a step back sometimes and remember that what we are doing here is very innovative. There are always pros and cons to running early experiments but essentially it boils down to nobody really knowing how things work. In absence of rules and standards, user’s feedback is the most valuable asset for whoever is building a business in crypto.

What is the best way to gather feedback? There is no clear-cut answer to this question. It is up to each entrepreneur's preferences and considerations on what fits best their business. NEAR Hispano for instance realized that they do not want standard survey forms sent out to everyone. Where they see value is having a one to one in-depth interview with students every now and then.

> “But now, if three people are working on a project and we ask how it went? Let them talk to us, if it goes well or if something goes wrong, or if something is missing. It is very one-by-one work, is the way we are getting that feedback.”
>
> Alan

This is when listening to your community and taking feedback seriously becomes critical for your success. Putting in place a feedback mechanism will help you understand faster which strategies are efficient and which aren’t.

> “We're still in the pursuit of improvement, which is part of how we get feedback because sometimes a community member tells us what is going right and what is going wrong. There is no structured mechanism.”
>
> Alan

Essentially, you have to test out and collect feedback all the time. Analyze and ask yourself if the way you are doing things could be improved. Then test again and get feedback. Analyze and challenge your baseline assumptions again. Yes, we are in Web3 but nobody canceled the old, good [double loop feedback model](https://www.edbatista.com/2007/03/tgroups.html).

## 9. Learn to Accept Failure and Try Out Different Routes
The truth is that despite our effort to share best practices with you here, the NEAR Hispano success formula won't work everywhere. That is also the beauty of it: it is okay not to have answers to everything in Web3.  As mentioned earlier, nobody in fact knows what they are doing in this space. The only requirement is a builder mindset - do you see something that could be better? Then go ahead and build it.

![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cMFc8rICuc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cMFc8rICuc)

> “I think that NEAR Hispano would not work the same in another place. I don't know if it will work somewhere, but if what we have done here is helpful I think that we hope they replicate, use what we have made for you.”
>
> Alan

Do not be scared to try things out and make mistakes. According to Claudio, NEAR Hispano missed a couple of points  along the road as well.
That is why we need to test, experiment and dare to take risks without too much self-reproach.

![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWqcIB7vmJI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWqcIB7vmJI)

> “I think we hammer ourselves too much when things don't work, when somebody just takes advantage of us or is a bad actor. I reckon we need to take a step back and understand what it is that this person or organization brought in learning to us.. Grab that learning, do not take the bad because I know it hurts. I know it frustrates, I know it angers but that doesn't build any momentum. Take a step back, learn and go back, and go back on the horse again, right. And I reckon that's gonna be the name of the game. How many times can we get on the ground, dust ourselves off and go back at it again and can every interaction be a learning experience, and that's about it. Take it with a grain of salt.”
>
> Claudio

If your enterprise does not work, we encourage you to go back to the drawing board and iterate.  Reflect on what happened. Share your experience with the community.  Iterate again till it starts working.Web3 is an emerging technology, as such, every builder is very much welcome to come onboard and realize their ideas. And frankly speaking, we find ourselves in the sweet spot where NEAR gives you a very real opportunity for doing so:

> “It is a green field, there are a lot of opportunities and a lot of people who like to teach! We need to create content, new initiatives, not try to copy. Start creating something new and start organizing”
>
> Cristian

> “I think NEAR Education has done a really good job. Shashi and Sherif in understanding that the only thing that they know is that they do not know, and so coming in being humble. They guided us in the sense of where they wanna head and then we said: ‘Hey where you wanna head? That's good but first we need to take these two or three steps, or maybe we need to rethink your approach’.  And they are open to do that.”
>
> Claudio

What we in fact try to aim at here is to prepare you to fail fast if you must.  The point is to not be discouraged as this ecosystem welcomes everybody regardless of age, background, gender, education. Do remember that NEAR is here to support you along the way as long as you dare trying and learn from your mistakes.  NEAR Hispano did that  a lot and look how far they’ve got.

# How to Apply These Principles to Your Business
Throughout this guide, we have shared the results of our analysis of the NEAR Hispano’s model focusing on drawing some practical tips and guidelines on how to start a thriving educational business with NEAR. After conducting in depth interviews, and analyzing NEAR Hispano’s trajectory, we were able to identify some key principles that we believe responsible for NEAR Hispano’s success. Since our recommendations were based on one case study alone, we suggest readers to critically evaluate them, and adjust these principles to the specificities of their context. While some recommendations might be valid for all contexts and situations, others will have to be adapted to the particular cultural and socio-economic specificities of one’s country.

Different experiences and backgrounds breed different values and needs. Being sensitive to differences will enable you to come up with specific solutions to encourage people to take part in your training program, and ultimately, to succeed.

> “I'm sure the NEAR Hispano formula won't work everywhere. I am very sure that if we applied the steps that have been done in Hispanic countries to Asian countries and replicated both things at the same time, in some places, it would most likely not have worked, and in the other, it would have gone very well, because everyone has its context. ”

> Alan

> “For me what are we putting on the table, basically an understanding that even if we speak the same language its region has its own thing, so it needs to be localized for reaching everyone in each and every region and that the up and coming region for this next year is Latam, that's it.”
>
> Claudio

Turning your educational business into a thriving and expanding business will largely depend on your ability to understand the context you are operating in, and your capacity to tailor strategies around it. While this guide serves as a source of insights, practical guidance, and perhaps inspiration, it is your own creativity and judgment that will make these principles come to life and evolve with experience.
