						<p id="text70" class="style1"><span>The term “Web3” refers to a new phase of internet development whereby blockchain technology, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, and decentralized systems are put in place to improve user experience and enhance data sovereignty. The idea of implementing a decentralized, open and inter-communicable network arose from the desire to create a human-centered internet, a safer, fairer and more transparent web. At core, Web3 is based on the assumption that allowing for the free flow of information creates more value and opportunities for everyone.</span><br /><br /><span>Web3 is coming to fruition today thanks to the rise of robust blockchain protocols that enable the growth of new paradigms in a variety of fields, from finance to art. NEAR Protocol is one of such robust protocols whose objective is to facilitate the births of cutting edge projects that will help bring forth a new Internet era.</span></p>

To this end, NEAR Education set out to create the necessary resources for onboarding developers and entrepreneurs into the NEAR ecosystem and facilitate their transition from Web2 to Web3. <a href="https://www.near.university/">NEAR University</a> creates a space where everyone interested in acquiring the skills needed to start building on NEAR can do so by following different training paths. The courses provided by NEAR University are targeted to train the new generation of Web3 entrepreneurs, developers, analysts, UX designers, and educators.</span><br /><br /><span>Through training and mentorship, these courses equip them with the knowledge and tools to kickstart their own projects and contribute to the making of Web3. These courses have been highly effective in bringing new people into the NEAR ecosystem and orienting them towards the best opportunities that the space can offer. In addition to instituting the NEAR University, NEAR Education has also encouraged the creation of regional educational hubs to increase its reach and attract talent from all over the world. NEAR Hispano is one such regional hub focused on the onboarding and mentoring of local talent and the pioneer of a new model for building thriving educational businesses. As blockchain technology and the concept of an open Web haven’t yet reached mass appeal, such initiatives are crucial to attracting entrepreneurs, developers, and ultimately users into NEAR Protocol.</span></p>

						<p id="text79" class="style1"><a href="https://nearhispano.org/">NEAR Hispano</a> is an educational community whose mission is to introduce NEAR Protocol in Spanish-speaking countries. Started in May 2021, NEAR Hispano distinguished itself for its educational programs and successful outreach campaigns, which brought over 600 developers from Latin American Countries into the NEAR ecosystem. In this section, we are going to provide an introduction to NEAR Hispano by introducing its mission and vision, how the idea of creating a NEAR regional hub for educating and onboarding developers came about, and its business model.</p>

						<p id="text12" class="style1"><span>NEAR Hispano is a regional hub that provides education and mentorship to local entrepreneurs, developers, and educators in Spanish speaking communities. By providing guidance in the local language, NEAR Hispano is able to open up new opportunities for economic development and innovation in communities with high human capital potential.</span><br /><br /><span>NEAR Hispano’s leader, <a href="https://medium.com/@ows-team/humans-of-the-open-web-sandbox-claudio-cossio-the-rise-of-a-pionear-guild-leader-67c7b314cc18">Claudio Cossio</a>, is a Mexican entrepreneur who has experienced first-hand the benefits of Web3 and the potential of the NEAR blockchain. Claudio has launched <a href="https://metapool.app/">Metapool</a>, one of the most successful and profitable dApps on the NEAR ecosystem. Having such great success and being aware of the life changing opportunities that the NEAR Protocol offers, Claudio dedicated his efforts to help more people get access to it as well. By setting up a team of entrepreneurs, developers, and educators from Latin American Countries (LATAM) that share the same objectives, Claudio was able to create a thriving educational business.</span><br /><br /><span>The NEAR Hispano team is committed to making Web3 accessible in LATAM by eliminating the language barrier–the biggest obstacle faced by developers and entrepreneurs in LATAM. As several NEAR Hispano team members pointed out: “English is a wall that prevents us from getting involved with this new technology” (Cristian). By making educational courses and the necessary resources available in Spanish, NEAR Hispano is able to bring Web3 and the possibilities that come with it to Spanish-speaking people.</span></p>
						<p id="text80" class="style9 quote">You are told that if you want to join the club only English is accepted. Like this you miss the opportunity to be developing what you want to. Blockchain is not an easy subject to learn, by having educational material and training opportunities in English you put an additional obstacle on people who want to know more. The first one is that they have to learn about blockchain, and the second one is that they have to learn English. This way you are cutting off opportunities, there is no reason for that barrier to exist. - <strong>Alan</strong></p>
						<p id="text82" class="style1">Being able to reach non-English speaking developers and entrepreneurs is essential for fostering Web3 adoption, the spread of NEAR blockchain, and the creation of a truly inclusive open Web. NEAR Hispano identified this pressing need and by understanding the challenges of local communities was able to put forward an effective plan of action to bring NEAR into LATAM and all Spanish speaking countries.</p>
						<p id="text83" class="style9 quote">When we started our first and foremost mission was to educate Spanish speaking community in any Spanish region in the world to understand what Near Protocol is all about, and more importantly what are the benefits of knowing what a blockchain is and what decentralized autonomous organizations or DAOs mean, and how this new change of paradigm is gonna be the next five to ten years, what&#39;s gonna be pushing the envelope in anything related to technology and more importantly just personal finance I reckon. - <strong>Claudio</strong></p>
						<p id="text81" class="style1">Education is key for attracting more people to Web3 as it helps raise awareness of the concrete opportunities. As Web3 remains largely unknown to the general public, there are still many prejudices attached to blockchain and crypto. Only through education can people&#39;s perspectives be changed and horizons broadened, and this is what NEAR Hispano is all about–broadening perspectives and creating opportunities.</p>

						<p id="text139" class="style1">A business model is critical to the success of any organization. It helps understand the steps, processes and decisions that are made to generate, deliver, and create value. While this is usually associated with monetary value, it can also relate to social, cultural and other contexts based on the nature of the enterprise. NEAR Hispano is no exception. Through interaction and input from its community, NEAR Hispano developed a business model that can be replicated and adopted by others.</p>

						<p id="text140" class="style7">The product</p>
						<p id="text141" class="style1"><span>NEAR Hispano introduces NEAR Protocol to Spanish speaking countries through education. This is achieved by delivering webinars, courses and certifications. They also support students in creating their own projects, enrolling in residency programs and applying for grants.</span><br /><br /><span>NEAR Hispano offers a variety of informative and educational materials that have been either created or translated from other groups including <a href="https://near.academy/">NEAR Academy</a> and <a href="https://nearguilds.com/">NEAR Guilds</a></span></p>
						<p id="text142" class="style7">The market</p>
						<p id="text148" class="style1"><span>At a high level, the NEAR Hispano target audience are people in Spanish speaking communities. This means that the reach of NEAR Hispano is not restricted to one country or continent. This makes their business model scalable and replicable. At a more granular level, NEAR Hispano targets developers and entrepreneurs.</span><br /><br /><span>In keeping with its mission to expand the reach of NEAR Protocol through education, NEAR Hispano focuses its efforts on attracting students and professors from universities in multiple LATAM countries.</span><br /><br /><span>For this initiative to scale, it is critical to train community members that can train newcomers to the ecosystem. As such, NEAR Hispano focuses on attracting and training professors. This model helps to grow the community and deliver the business objectives.</span></p>
						<p id="text143" class="style7">The delivery</p>
						<p id="text149" class="style1"><span>NEAR Hispano reaches its target audience by growing its community rather than by investing in marketing. Unlike a regular enterprise, NEAR Hispano focuses on building relationships with other groups and communities that can help them expand its reach. It works closely with other groups within NEAR Protocol like NEAR University, and its members participate in different activities to spread the word about NEAR Hispano. Many of its members are also successful entrepreneurs that help bring more people to the ecosystem.</span><br /><br /><span>By growing its connections across many different LATAM countries, NEAR Hispano reaches universities and delivers webinars to educate professors and students on the opportunities available with NEAR Protocol.</span><br /><br /><span>These communities, the courses, and the day to day interactions of the groups are primarily maintained in two platforms: <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/855182002981830656/855182002981830663">Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/NEARHispano">Telegram</a>.</span><br /><br /><span>Their educational activities are delivered by bringing together a group of experts that help put together dynamic and interactive courses, as well as certification programs:</span><br /><span class="li"><a href="https://www.near.university/courses/near-certified-developer">Near Certified Developer (NCD)</a>,</span><span class="li"><a href="https://www.near.university/courses/near-certified-analyst">Near Certified Analyst (NCA)</a>,</span><span><span class="li">and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQz8n4pSQdk&amp;list=PLixWO0N_iFTMZ9cSaB_b4GnwNmCus-_qVd-professors-near-hispano-d01cb0f4b914">Near Certified Professor (NCP)</a>.</span></span></p>
						<p id="text144" class="style7">The expense</p>
						<p id="text150" class="style1"><span>The costs for running this program are relatively low compared to those of a new startup, which may include:</span><br /><br /><span><strong>Startup costs:</strong></span><br /><span class="li">Legal fees</span><span class="li">Office furniture</span><span class="li">Rent</span><span class="li">Market research</span><span class="li">Consultants</span><span class="li">Signage</span><span class="li">Startup cash balances</span><br /><span><strong>Ongoing operating expenses:</strong></span><br /><span class="li">Rent</span><span class="li">Legal Fees</span><span class="li">Payroll</span><span class="li">Marketing and Advertising</span><span class="li">Supplies</span><span class="li">Travel Expenses</span><span class="li">Training</span><br /><span>Many of these can be avoided because the work is completed by NEAR Hispano core members, who have dedicated themselves to build this community. In addition, work can be completed remotely without the need to set up offices, purchase equipment, etc. Another considerable expense for any business relates to Marketing and Advertising, which are considerably reduced by leveraging the already existent network of professionals and enthusiasts that surround NEAR Protocol. NEAR Hispano also works closely with NEAR Education and the NEAR Foundation to obtain the funds that are needed to run its operations.</span></p>
						<p id="text145" class="style7">The value</p>
						<p id="text151" class="style1"><span>In the end, it is critical to ensure that value is generated and to measure it. In the case of NEAR Hispano, value is generated in different ways:</span><br /><span class="li">Spanish speaking people gain access to a technology that seemed unreachable before. They can now further their education and start their own projects.</span><span class="li">NEAR Protocol gains adoption. Hundreds of new users among developers, entrepreneurs and professors become versed on NEAR Protocol and its functionality. These individuals also spread the word and invite others to join the ecosystem.</span><span><span class="li">NEAR Hispano members and participants are remunerated for their efforts. How much they earn depends on the projects and activities they complete. These funds are obtained through grants offered by the NEAR Foundation.</span></span></p>

						<p id="text152" class="style1"><span>There is a number of funding opportunities (<a href="https://near.org/grants/">NEAR Grants</a>) at NEAR that enable community members to launch new projects and help grow the NEAR ecosystem. A variety of grants is available for different kinds of businesses and initiatives and it&#39;s important to identify the one that fits one’s initiative best.</span><br /><br /><span>One way to prove the value of one’s initiative and justify a funding request is to establish a community presence within the ecosystem by creating a Guild. <a href="https://near.org/guilds/">Guilds</a>, are groups that share a common vision and mission; they are the social force behind the growth of NEAR Protocol. When NEAR Hispano created a Guild (<a href="https://near.org/start-a-guild/">Start a Guild</a>), they received a small initial budget from NEAR Foundation to run its activities including creating content, organizing webinars and helping future students to set up their NEAR Wallet. Today, gone far beyond the Guild status, NEAR Hispano works closely with NEAR University to develop its educational content. This collaboration opens more doors for grants from NEAR University (<a href="https://www.near.university/earn/grants">Near University Grants</a>).</span><br /><br /><span>The focus is not only on obtaining grants to fund the activities of NEAR Hispano, but mostly on helping community members obtain their own grants and further develop their Web3 careers. As such, NEAR Hispano mentors work closely with those who complete their <a href="#final-products">courses</a>. By understanding the particular needs of each person, NEAR Hispano mentors help individuals obtain grants that fit their projects and objectives well. One major entryway that NEAR Hispano promotes is helping people to enroll in one of <a href="https://www.near.university/earn/fellowship">NEAR’S Education Fellowship programs</a>:</span><br /><span class="li">Entrepreneur in Residence,</span><span class="li">Developer in Residence,</span><span class="li">Designer in Residence,</span><span class="li">Teacher in Residence,</span><span class="li">Writer in Residence</span><span><span class="li">or Researcher in Residence.</span></span></p>

						<p id="text156" class="style1"><span>Building an effective and cohesive team can be a daunting task. Given knowledge gaps, different skill sets, and individual scheduling/availability, creating a team can be very difficult. NEAR Hispano is a testament to the fact that building a team under these circumstances, although challenging, is not an insurmountable task and that is best achieved through community engagement.</span><br /><br /><span>As the founder of NEAR Hispano, Claudio Cossio was very resourceful in establishing his own team. In the initial phase of his recruitment process, Claudio used his existing network to seek feedback and gauge interest. This approach ensured Claudio was able to reach out to other Spanish speakers in the community with whom he had rapport and common interests. He established a <a href="#intro-near-h">NEAR Hispano core group</a> with a shared vision (Rosa Maria Orellana, Alejandro Van Beta , Manuel Haro, Juan Manuel Cancino, Rodrigo Moreno, Claudio Cossio, and shortly thereafter Cristian Zambrano, Luz Margarita Saucedo and Christopher Alan Estrada). Claudio believed that a collaborative spirit and the humility to recognize knowledge gaps would enable his team to succeed in outreach and “connect the dots.”</span></p>

							</div>
						</div>
						<p id="text153" class="style1">As a way of “connecting dots,” Claudio and his team began outreach through their respective networks, connecting with people who had experience in the Web3 industry. This grassroots approach depended on word of mouth and community relationships to build membership. It ensured Claudio’s intent of shared vision and passion. It brought together people in the community with skill sets that strengthen the overall team, adding depth, knowledge, perspective and experience to an already solid foundation.</p>
						<p id="text157" class="style7">Lean into Community and Engage in Reciprocal Collaboration</p>
						<p id="text163" class="style1"><span>Building on his initial momentum, Claudio created a NEAR Hispano Guild, which created visibility in the NEAR community and also expanded NEAR Hispano’s access to the support of the greater NEAR community. This support was instrumental in the success of NEAR Hispano and guided Claudio’s approach to community engagement.</span><br /><br /><span>Selfless support of others often leads to reciprocity and maintains a tone of care and respect within the community. This type of relationship building has enabled Claudio to reach talent and engage individuals across languages, borders and time zones.</span></p>
						<p id="text158" class="style7">Outreach through Relevant and Targeted Community Events</p>
						<p id="text164" class="style1">When visibility and community are compounded, they serve to build momentum and outreach in a way that more traditional means of recruitment such as advertising and paid focus groups rarely can. Claudio built on this momentum and visibility in the next phase of his process by hosting community outreach programs such as hackathons, guest speaking at tech events, and webinars for universities that targeted professors, teachers and students.</p>
						<p id="text159" class="style7">Team Up!</p>
						<p id="text165" class="style1"><span>Collaborating with other groups within NEAR, such as NEAR University, enabled NEAR Hispano to further compound skill sets and passion and to expand communication and interest. A commitment to collaborate, support and give back fostered a culture of trust and a community focused on honesty and support.</span><br /><br /><span>This foundation of trust allows NEAR Hispano to have a level of vulnerability and humility that ensures teams are effective in their work and willing to be honest and flexible in approach. This serves to reinforce a supportive and collaborative environment.</span></p>
						<p id="text160" class="style7">Reflect and Strive to Improve Diversity and Inclusion</p>
						<p id="text166" class="style1"><span>In addition to trust and collaboration, NEAR Hispano focuses on diversity and inclusion in a meaningful way. Asking key questions and creating safe and accessible learning spaces ensure that diverse talent is reached. NEAR Hispano poses the following questions while conducting outreach:</span><br /><br /><span class="li">Can we bring enough women, LGBTQ2S+ individuals, people with disabilities, and other marginalized people into the space? Can we really give them an opportunity to excel?</span><span class="li">Can we nurture talent? Can the talent be diverse (arts, finance, agriculture, tourism etc.)?</span><br /><span>Asking these questions allows NEAR Hispano to reflect both on success and areas of growth when diversifying its team. In doing so, the team can define new goals and adjust to meet them in an ongoing and meaningful way. A vulnerability and willingness to define areas that need improvement creates both a safe workspace and a more qualified talent pool.</span></p>

						<p id="text161" class="style7">Recognize Existing Resources and Identify Learner Needs</p>
						<p id="text167" class="style1">NEAR Hispano recognized an opportunity to make education more accessible by removing barriers to entry. Translating content into Spanish and creating a student-centered approach to instruction were identified as key success factors. This vision drove the partnership with NEAR University, ensuring an effective collaboration open to adaptation and adjustment based on learner needs. In addition, the strong partnership fostered between NEAR University and NEAR Hispano ensured an avenue for feedback and suggestions regarding course structure and content.</p>
						<p id="text162" class="style7">4.1 NEAR Hispano vs NEAR University Courses</p>
						<p id="text181" class="style1">NEAR Hispano courses mirror those of NEAR University without noticeable technical differences; what sets them apart is their focus. From the start, NEAR Hispano understood that the focus should be on how the courses are delivered and not so much on changing their content. This meant developing an educational strategy that emphasized designing courses that facilitated an agile approach to course delivery.</p>

										<p id="text185" class="style1">NEAR Hispano’s courses are designed to promote the interaction between instructors and students. As courses contain new and dense technical content that can be difficult to absorb without the right support system in place, NEAR Hispano uses both synchronous and asynchronous spaces during the certification programs that are offered (NCD, NCA and NCP). The synchronous spaces take place on a daily basis and allow students to bring forward questions related to the course content, while the asynchronous spaces are maintained in the NEAR Hispano’s Discord server. Each course counts with their own Discord channels that offer an opportunity to share ideas and promote the interaction between students; they also offer an avenue to ask questions to instructors, certified developers and other experts involved with NEAR Hispano:</p>
										<p id="text186" class="style1">This approach proved to be successful as students benefited from the continuous support by NEAR Hispano to help them navigate the Web3 ecosystem.</p>

						</div>
						<p id="text180" class="style10">Asynchronous Approach and Agile Delivery</p>
						<p id="text182" class="style1">The aforementioned daily sync sessions of the courses follow the concept of a daily stand-up, a ceremony commonly used in <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/about-scrum">Scrum</a> (an Agile framework). These sessions are used to discuss progress at a high level and not to troubleshoot any problems. The goal is to understand how things are going, identify any roadblocks and next steps. This is achieved by asking students the following three questions:</p>

						<p id="text184" class="style1"><span>The instructor plays the role of a Scrum Master by maintaining the conversation on topic and within the allotted time. This approach ensures that progress is made everyday and that any roadblocks to learning are promptly removed. This way to deliver a program also enables positive engagements between students, facilitates the learning process and promotes ownership of the course by each and everyone of the participants.</span><br /><br /><span>Learning is not limited to theoretical learning, but it is also practical. Students, with the support of NEAR Hispano experts, are asked to develop their own projects during the course. This allows them to apply the new knowledge acquired and achieve their learning objectives.</span></p>
						<p id="text187" class="style10">Post Certification</p>
						<p id="text188" class="style1"><span>The NEAR Hispano experience is not limited to providing participants access to courses in their own language, but on supporting them to build their careers in Web3. This is achieved through two key pillars:</span><br /><br /><span><strong>1. Creating spaces for everyone</strong></span><br /><br /><span>No matter what a person goals are, he/she will find a space within the community:</span><br /><span class="li">If you are a developer, there is a space for you.</span><span class="li">If you have a project idea and want to explore it and execute it, there is a space for you.</span><span class="li">If you want to teach, there is a space for you.</span><span class="li">If you want to learn Web3 from scratch, there is a space for you.</span><span>This is what makes NEAR Hispanos’s approach to education more special. It’s not just another school, it’s a COMMUNITY.</span><br /><br /><span><strong>2. Building relationships</strong></span><br /><br /><span>A key success factor for any individual that starts a new career or takes on a new challenge is their support network. NEAR Hispano graduates are encouraged to stay in touch and learn that they can count on their peers even after their courses are complete. An example of this is the NEAR Hispano Developers in Residence group, which as of this day still have daily meetings in Discord where they share their progress and ask for feedback.</span></p>
						<p id="text190" class="style10">Designing the Courses and Involving the Experts</p>
						<p id="text189" class="style1"><span>Luz Margarita, a PhD in Education with experience in this field, was invited to join NEAR Hispano to identify areas of improvement based on how courses were being delivered by NEAR University, and to develop an educational approach that could meet the needs of the NEAR Hispano community. As part of her strategy, she enrolled in the NEAR certified developer program, which allowed her to gain an insider&#39;s perspective and provide meaningful feedback.</span><br /><br /><span>The partnership with NEAR University allowed Luz Margarita to tap into resources she knew already existed and in doing so was able to effectively define goals of learning and development. Having a primary goal to translate content into Spanish, whilst tailoring content to align with the needs of the people within the NEAR Hispano ecosystem.</span></p>
						<p id="text191" class="style10">Complete the Bootcamp - From Expert to Becoming a Web3 Subject Matter Expert</p>
						<p id="text199" class="style1">Enrolling in the NEAR University Bootcamp, provided Luz the opportunity to learn how blockchain technology works, and how to use it on a daily basis. Luz gained a greater understanding about the topic, and was able to create a strategy that could be adapted to promote a deep understanding of NEAR for all NEAR Hispano participants. Luz knew that barriers such as language and unclear pathways, could inhibit access to learning and hinder learner progress:</p>
						<p id="text194" class="style9 quote">“ You cannot do a course from your level of knowledge, you must do it from a level of understanding in which the trainee is encouraged to advance and learn” - Luz Margarita</p>
						<p id="text198" class="style1">By combining her understanding of the models of education and user experience, Luz was better able to define an approach that would not simply translate content, but transfer knowledge in a meaningful and user specific way.</p>
						<p id="text192" class="style10">Lean into Your Strengths as an Educator and Know Your Learner</p>
						<p id="text195" class="style1"><span>After having acquired a deep understanding of both the courses and the technology, Luz was able to combine her expertise in education and her new knowledge to develop NEAR Hispano courses.This meant not simply translating the courses into Spanish, but also transiting the delivery in a manner that demystified technical and specific languages, thus removing other barriers to entry. Luz knew that learners are different and have different learning needs. Meeting students where they were at, and planning a specific course delivery based on diverse student needs improved engagement and achievement and ultimately produced more effective instructors.</span><br /><br /><span>NEAR Hispano recognized that well defined and contextualized content enabled instructors to become subject matter experts, and in turn, become effective instructors facilitating knowledge transfer (an integral component of NEAR Hispano).</span></p>
						<p id="text193" class="style10">Create Learning Paths that Promote Self-Directed Learning</p>
						<p id="text196" class="style1">NEAR Hispano uses learning paths to promote self-guided instruction, while keeping each person accountable to fulfill their individual learning responsibilities. NEAR Hispano maintains that the most important focus of course development is customization based on learning needs. Taking the time to understand learners&#39; needs allows instruction to be tailored and specific in a way that is engaging and motivating. Moreover, taking the time to know about a learner&#39;s needs builds a rapport, a sense of trust and most importantly the opportunity to reflect and adjust as needed. The end result is empowered learners able to adapt and apply the protocol in a meaningful way, and an instructor who becomes more effective in recognizing and adapting content based on learner needs.</p>
						<p id="text171" class="style7">4.2 Day Zero Challenge - From pre-work to work</p>
						<p id="text183" class="style1"><span>NEAR University does an excellent job at creating and delivering content that allows participants to build their careers in Web3. Part of this means encouraging participants to also show their commitment by completing work on their own that is required to succeed in the different programs.</span><br /><br /><span>This is where the “Day Zero Challenge” comes into play. The Day Zero Challenge refers to the 20+ hours of pre-work required by students before starting the course. Students have to go through the educational material provided (videos, readings, exercises) and acquire the basic skills independently. This is a good way to provide students with the tools required to succeed in their certifications, but to also know who are those individuals that are really committed to start a career in Web3.</span><br /><br /><span>NEAR Hispano recognized the importance of this challenge but at the same time, it understood that it could bear a heavy burden on those individuals that were completely new to Web3 or that had other commitments (i.e. other jobs, projects, etc.). This resulted in students dropping before the courses started, or during the first days of the courses after realizing that not completing the Day Zero Challenge meant to start far behind the rest of the group. The solution to this problem, which proved to be very successful, was to include the Day Zero Challenge as part of the courses. (Today the whole <a href="https://www.near.university/courses/near-certified-analyst">NCA course</a> is based on the pre-work materials). While students were still responsible for completing the work on their own, they now had the opportunity to do it while being able to ask questions to the instructors and share ideas with their peers.</span></p>
						<p id="text200" class="style10">Define an Education Process with Clear Stages through an Ongoing Project Development</p>
						<p id="text203" class="style1"><span>NEAR Hispano breaks their education process into the following stages, with focus on project development at each stage to ensure participants maintain motivation and enthusiasm:</span><br /><br /><span>1. Work with NEAR to visualize what project could be developed, and have some idea of where the project can be applied</span><br /><span>2. Develop the project, incorporating additional elements</span><br /><span>3. Apply to the Fellowship.</span><br /><br /><span>At each stage, the project is further developed to encourage progress and continued learning</span></p>
						<p id="text201" class="style10">Learners Become Subject Matter Experts and Facilitators (with hands-on experience)</p>
						<p id="text204" class="style1"><span>As each participant completes their projects, they in turn will become facilitators capable of delivering content with the strength of having hands-on experience. Once the learning is completed, participants will get their Fellowship and benefit from ongoing mentorship and support.</span><br /><span>This approach allows students to become trainers capable of customizing and delivering course content to other learners in a specialized manner reflective of NEAR Hispano methodologies.</span></p>

						<p id="text208" class="style1">After the design of NEAR Hispano’s business model, the drafting of funding application, and course development, the first challenge encountered by the team was how to reach people, and communicate the value of their offer:</p>
						<p id="text209" class="style9 quote">“One thing is to develop and run courses, and the other is to find individuals to sell these courses to. Day 0 is critical, and is the most challenging moment because you have to figure out how to attract people to your program and motivate them to participate.” - Claudio</p>
						<p id="text206" class="style1">Finding a unique selling proposition (USP) requires a deep understanding of both the context in which you are going to promote your product, the value it delivers to its customers, and the ability to create a sense of urgency.</p>
						<p id="text207" class="style9 quote">“How can you market your product to people? Literally, you make an offer “Hey, here is a cool opportunity, you have the chance to learn today, because in 18 months this learning opportunity will not be here anymore. Today is the time to get engaged, and reap the benefits of being there early. If you come today with your Web2 firm full of devs and get NEAR Certified, we might be able to put you on a project to work on” - Claudio</p>
						<p id="text197" class="style1">Creating the first batch of NEAR educators is essential for sustaining your educational program. Without more educators joining your project will not be able to scale and reach full potential. As there is no right formula for attracting motivated individuals to your business, you might have to try out different strategies before finding the right one. After months since inception, NEAR Hispano is still adjusting its strategies for obtaining even better results, paying particular attention to its events and communication.</p>
						<p id="text173" class="style7">Conducting Effective Outreach Campaigns</p>
						<div id="video13" class="style1 video">
							<div class="frame">
								<iframe src="" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UgRhTxbKUP0?autoplay=0&amp;rel=0&amp;loop=0&amp;controls=1&amp;cc_load_policy=0" allowfullscreen="1"></iframe>

						</div>
						<p id="text175" class="style1">NEAR Hispano conducts strategic outreach campaigns in order to promote its courses. In this section, we provide an overview of the considerations that inform their approach and strategies.</p>
						<p id="text174" class="style7">Tailor Your Strategy to Your Target</p>
						<p id="text176" class="style1"><span>When starting your outreach campaign, it is essential that you develop a good understanding of what the person in front of you might want and at the same time have a clear and appealing offer to propose. Universities, for instance, are different from the private sector, therefore a different approach is recommended.</span><br /><br /><span>According to Claudio Cossio, while universities might be more willing to invest in the long-term future, the private sector is generally more oriented on achieving short term goals. Changing paradigms always pose a potential risk for businesses, and although your proposition brings innovation to their firm, fear of endangering their work-flow might lead them to pass on the opportunity. To bring in more entrepreneurs, NEAR Hispano focused on organizing events, and hackathons that would give entrepreneurs the opportunity of immediate gains.</span><br /><br /><span>Creating opportunities to showcase the benefits of your program, in the form of events, meetups, and hackathons, will enable entrepreneurs to overcome their fears and skepticism. Involving more people from the industry, also makes your proposal acquire tangibility in the eyes of entrepreneurs and help them trust your initiative.</span></p>
						<p id="text210" class="style7">Start with Low-hanging Fruits</p>
						<p id="text177" class="style1"><span>Web3 is still an unknown world to many people. Numerous biased media reports on scams limit understanding of Web3 and often are an impetus for people to turn the other way and decide not to learn about it. In the first stages of your projects you want to start off by engaging those firms and individuals that have already been involved with this technology, or show interest in transitioning toward it.</span><br /><br /><span>As your resources are not infinite, you need to identify which firms and universities show welcoming attitudes towards Web3 and focus on bringing them onboard first. Those that show interest towards Web3 will be more likely to understand the value of what you are offering them and will be quick to get involved.</span></p>
						<p id="text211" class="style7">Leverage Your Network</p>
						<p id="text178" class="style1"><span>When starting out your outreach campaign it is useful to start off with connecting with businesses and individuals in your social circle. It makes sense to draw from your existent resources as much as possible and spread the word with people that trust you.</span><br /><br /><span>Leveraging your network always presents advantages, not only because people you know are more likely to listen and consider your proposal with an open mind but also because they might help you access their own network.</span></p>
						<p id="text212" class="style7">Be Honest and Clear about Your Goals</p>
						<p id="text215" class="style1">The number one rule to win people’s trust is to be honest and crystal clear about your intentions and what interest parties will gain from your program.</p>
						<p id="text216" class="style9 quote">“For me it’s always been about just putting people in the right places at the right time, it&#39;s just connecting the dots, that&#39;s what I do…I put value on the table and open up doors for people. I think that&#39;s first and foremost. The best way of earning people&#39;s trust in you, and earning people&#39;s trust in partnerships as well .” - Claudio</p>
						<p id="text213" class="style1">While you need to make sure that you adapt your communication to the person in front of you, you also want to set clear expectations.You should be as detailed as possible in regards to what the opportunities are, how funding works, and what they can expect once they finish the course.</p>

						<h2 id="text134" class="style8">How to Apply These Principles to Your Business</h2>
						<p id="text133" class="style1"><span>Throughout this guide, we have shared the results of our analysis of the NEAR Hispano’s model focusing on drawing some practical tips and guidelines on how to start a thriving educational business with NEAR. After conducting in depth interviews, and analyzing NEAR Hispano’s trajectory, we were able to identify some key principles that we believe responsible for NEAR Hispano’s success. Since our recommendations were based on one case study alone, we suggest readers to critically evaluate them, and adjust these principles to the specificities of their context. While some recommendations might be valid for all contexts and situations, others will have to be adapted to the particular cultural and socio-economic specificities of one’s country.</span><br /><br /><span>Different experiences and backgrounds breed different values and needs. Being sensitive to differences will enable you to come up with specific solutions to encourage people to take part in your training program, and ultimately, to succeed.</span></p>

						<p id="text132" class="style9 quote">&quot;I&#39;m sure the NEAR Hispano formula won&#39;t work everywhere. I am very sure that if we applied the steps that have been done in Hispanic countries to Asian countries and replicated both things at the same time, in some places, it would most likely not have worked, and in the other, it would have gone very well, because everyone has its context. - <strong>Alan</strong>&quot;</p>
						<p id="text127" class="style9 quote">&quot;For me what are we putting on the table, basically an understanding that even if we speak the same language its region has its own thing, so it needs to be localized for reaching everyone in each and every region and that the up and coming region for this next year is Latam, that&#39;s it. - <strong>Claudio</strong>&quot;</p>
						<p id="text135" class="style1">Turning your educational business into a thriving and expanding business will largely depend on your ability to understand the context you are operating in, and your capacity to tailor strategies around it. While this guide serves as a source of insights, practical guidance, and perhaps inspiration, it is your own creativity and judgment that will make these principles come to life and evolve with experience.</p>

						<p id="text86" class="style1"><span>It is your job as an entrepreneur to determine what your organizational values are and make sure your whole enterprise is radiating them to the customer. And this is different from the features of the amazing teaching course you are building. The high quality of your teaching course is critical, however, you also need people to feel they associate with your programme. You need to make sure they stand behind your way of doing business. This means that on top of liking your courses or the “what”, they need to support the procedures or the “how” and the “why” of your enterprise. You need them to agree and relate with your philosophy of doing things. Only then will they bring friends and family to build a tight and harmonious community.</span><br /><br /><span>Today everyone in NEAR Hispano is extremely proud of their community being empathetic. NEAR Hispano&#39;s business case clearly demonstrated that it could not succeed in building an educational community in such a niche industry as crypto without understanding, and truly recognizing the problems people have specifically in their region. Because crypto is a field that is still ridden by prejudices, you need to know what students&#39; circumstances are. Whether it is a lack of technological savviness or a fear to get scammed, or anything else, you need to care about it as if it is your own struggle. Essentially, you need empathy. As Manuel says:</span></p>

						<p id="text90" class="style9 quote">&quot;The things that we at NEAR Hispano work on are based on seeking empathy and attracting everyone to get involved in NEAR Hispano and work voluntarily, but looking for a benefit. And I&#39;m not talking about economic benefits, I&#39;m talking about professional, technical, and personal gain. So it is about looking for that empathy in NEAR Hispano&quot;</p>
						<p id="text91" class="style1">According to the NEAR Hispano’s team, their success was largely dependent on the fact that they understood the pain points of their region and started to get on board early.</p>
						<p id="text92" class="style9 quote">&quot;..And in this way, we have achieved that some universities, for example, have already worked on formalizing specializations in their computer systems or blockchain-based computing careers. But the interesting thing is that we managed to do it with the NEAR Protocol. So that is an excellent achievement because we are discovering empathy. We have found that universities find some benefit and value for their students in everything NEAR Hispano has done.&quot;</p>
						<p id="text93" class="style1">Understanding the nature of people’s attitude towards blockchain and starting to see the situation from the perspective of the newcomer is something you cannot ignore in Web3. When community members feel their concerns are heard and addressed, they are less likely to leave and are more likely to develop trust in your team. As a payback, they will be more passionate about the success of your business and they will share their thoughts on how to improve. They will give your feedback - the most valuable asset. Manuel remarks:</p>
						<p id="text94" class="style9 quote">&quot;I think that we have been building a community… The vision and the need for people to collaborate, to work as a team, to feel in an environment of more trust, to be able to share.&quot;</p>
						<p id="text89" class="style1"><span>Empathy is just one way to create a safe space in the community around your educational programme. We are sure there is more. The question here is “What will make people proud when they join my community?” Is that the region they belong to? Do they feel proud because your service allows them to do good for their specific age-group? Profession? Hobby? Try to define that early and emphasize that whenever you can. New members should not be guessing this on their own - it must strike them in the face when they join. Hand these fulfilling values to them on a silver plate.</span><br /><br /><span>Whatever you choose as your guiding principles, your business value, it is not enough to put it on the website and forget about it. The goal is to align your values with every single activity executed by the enterprise so make sure that these identified values are living through your business.</span></p>

The business structure you choose will influence everything from day-to-day operations, to taxes, and will ensure the smooth continuation of your business. When making your own considerations you should keep in mind that a simpler and flexible structure will help you spend your energies on your work. A way to keep it simple is to standardize processes when it comes to taxes, time invested in the project, and all other aspects related to organization.</span><br /><span>Since you want your business to scale, you need to make sure your structure helps you achieve this goal instead of hindering you. It is also important that once you choose your structure you remain open to feedback on how to improve and carry out the changes needed depending on the arising needs.</span></p>

						<p id="text100" class="style1">There are many like-minded people that might be trying to achieve the same goal as you or that might be interested in helping you out. Reaching out to those people, sharing your doubts and struggles, receiving their opinions and support will be of invaluable help. As your ultimate goal will be that of educating entrepreneurs and developers, and onboarding them onto the NEAR ecosystem, being involved with the community will enable you to stay up to date with the opportunities and initiatives that might help your students get involved at a deeper level.</p>

You can meet people in the most random places but you can also start with those nearest and dearest to you. Your friends and family. A crucial privilege that you gain by starting your journey with them is trust. Having someone you can trust and confide in their capabilities and commitment can be incredibly helpful in the first stages of your project. When you can rely on your team members, the workflow can run more smoothly, and precious time and resources can be saved. Responsibilities can be delegated and team members can run their tasks independently without the need of being double-checked.</p>

						<p id="text103" class="style1">The core team of NEAR Hispano is essentially a group of friends that was brought together by one motivated individual with a noble vision. He talked to his friends and invited his amazing mother to join the team because of her PhD background in education. This is not something uncommon in the NEAR ecosystem. Outstanding individuals bring into the ecosystem more outstanding individuals they trust thus creating an efficient network of people that are not only driven by rewards but by care for their communities.</p>

In order to make your program as inclusive and attractive as possible, it is then fundamental to keep this in mind and try to meet people where they are at.

What might prevent people from enrolling into this course? What do people need in order to feel motivated enough to participate?</span><br /><span>Answering these questions will enable you to adjust your approach based on the circumstances and make your program more appealing.

In such an environment, mentorship is crucial to ensure that newcomers do not feel discouraged.

Following people closely allows them to feel supported and reduces the likelihood of dropouts.

						<p id="text119" class="style1"><span>It is important to take a step back sometimes and remember that what we are doing here is very innovative. There are always pros and cons to running early experiments but essentially it boils down to nobody really knowing how things work. In absence of rules and standards, user’s feedback is the most valuable asset for whoever is building a business in crypto.</span><br /><br /><span>What is the best way to gather feedback? There is no clear-cut answer to this question. It is up to each entrepreneur&#39;s preferences and considerations on what fits best their business. NEAR Hispano for instance realized that they do not want standard survey forms sent out to everyone. Where they see value is having a one to one in-depth interview with students every now and then.</span></p>
						<p id="text120" class="style9 quote">&quot;But now, if three people are working on a project and we ask how it went? Let them talk to us, if it goes well or if something goes wrong, or if something is missing. It is very one-by-one work, is the way we are getting that feedback. - <strong>Alan</strong>&quot;</p>
						<p id="text121" class="style1">This is when listening to your community and taking feedback seriously becomes critical for your success. Putting in place a feedback mechanism will help you understand faster which strategies are efficient and which aren’t.</p>
						<p id="text122" class="style9 quote">&quot;We&#39;re still in the pursuit of improvement, which is part of how we get feedback because sometimes a community member tells us what is going right and what is going wrong. There is no structured mechanism. - <strong>Alan</strong>&quot;</p>
						<p id="text118" class="style1">Essentially, you have to test out and collect feedback all the time. Analyze and ask yourself if the way you are doing things could be improved. Then test again and get feedback. Analyze and challenge your baseline assumptions again. Yes, we are in Web3 but nobody canceled the old, good <a href="https://www.edbatista.com/2007/03/tgroups.html">double loop feedback model</a>.</p>

I reckon we need to take a step back and understand what it is that this person or organization brought in learning to us.. Grab that learning, do not take the bad because I know it hurts. I know it frustrates, I know it angers but that doesn&#39;t build any momentum. Take a step back, learn and go back, and go back on the horse again, right. And I reckon that&#39;s gonna be the name of the game. How many times can we get on the ground, dust ourselves off and go back at it again and can every interaction be a learning experience, and that&#39;s about it. Take it with a grain of salt. - <strong>Claudio</strong>&quot;</p>
						<p id="text128" class="style1">If your enterprise does not work, we encourage you to go back to the drawing board and iterate. Reflect on what happened. Share your experience with the community. Iterate again till it starts working. Web3 is an emerging technology, as such, every builder is very much welcome to come onboard and realize their ideas. And frankly speaking, we find ourselves in the sweet spot where NEAR gives you a very real opportunity for doing so:</p>
						<p id="text131" class="style9 quote">&quot;It is a green field, there are a lot of opportunities and a lot of people who like to teach! We need to create content, new initiatives, not try to copy. Start creating something new and start organizing - <strong>Cristian</strong>&quot;</p>
						<p id="text115" class="style9 quote">&quot;I think NEAR Education has done a really good job. Shashi and Sherif in understanding that the only thing that they know is that they do not know, and so coming in being humble. They guided us in the sense of where they wanna head and then we said: ‘Hey where you wanna head? That&#39;s good but first we need to take these two or three steps, or maybe we need to rethink your approach’. And they are open to do that. - <strong>Claudio</strong>&quot;</p>
						<p id="text130" class="style1">What we in fact try to aim at here is to prepare you to fail fast if you must. The point is to not be discouraged as this ecosystem welcomes everybody regardless of age, background, gender, education. Do remember that NEAR is here to support you along the way as long as you dare trying and learn from your mistakes. NEAR Hispano did that a lot and look how far they’ve got.</p>

Started in May 2021, NEAR Hispano distinguished itself for its educational programs and successful outreach campaigns, which brought over 600 developers from Latin American Countries into the NEAR ecosystem. In this section, we are going to provide an introduction to NEAR Hispano by introducing its mission and vision, how the idea of creating a NEAR regional hub for educating and onboarding developers came about, and its business model.</p>
