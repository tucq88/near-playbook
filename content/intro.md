# Introduction to the Playbook

This guide was designed to provide a framework, based on the concrete experience, of NEAR Hispano to entrepreneurs that are eager to foster Web3 adoption through building their own business on [NEAR Protocol](https://near.org/).  Here we provide them with a guide to build their own educational business with NEAR and kickstart regional development.

Before setting off to share our insights and recommendations on how to start a business with NEAR, our first goal is to set the stage for understanding the relevance of education on Web3 and NEAR’s mission to bring forth the third Web revolution.

## Web3 –  A Human-Centered Internet

The term “Web3” refers to a new phase of internet development whereby blockchain technology, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, and decentralized systems are put in place to improve user experience and enhance data sovereignty. The idea of implementing a decentralized, open and inter-communicable network arose from the desire to create a human-centered internet, a safer, fairer and more transparent web. At core, Web3 is based on the assumption that allowing for the free flow of information creates more value and opportunities for everyone.

Web3 is coming to fruition today thanks to the rise of robust blockchain protocols that enable the growth of new paradigms in a variety of fields, from finance to art. NEAR Protocol is one of such robust protocols whose objective is to facilitate the births of cutting edge projects that will help bring forth a new Internet era.

## NEAR’s Mission

[NEAR](https://near.org/) is a high-performance blockchain specifically designed to be super-fast, secure,  infinitely scalable, and [climate neutral](https://near.org/blog/near-climate-neutral-product/). NEAR’s vision is to provide the solid foundation upon which a new network can be created, a network that enables people to reimagine finance, ownership, creativity, and new business ideas. Thanks to its technology, NEAR is able to empower millions of people to invent, explore new experiences, and build a fairer, more sustainable, and inclusive future. NEAR is already home to over [350 projects](https://awesomenear.com/) that are leveraging NEAR’s architecture in order to create thriving businesses and vibrant communities of innovation-oriented minds.

## Fostering Web3 Adoption Through Education

[NEAR’s infrastructure](https://near.org/blog/near-education-1000-teachers-program/) is ready to propel the third Web revolution and open up a new frontier for developers and entrepreneurs interested in creating innovative businesses. To this end, NEAR Education set out to create the necessary resources for onboarding developers and entrepreneurs into the NEAR ecosystem and facilitate their transition from Web2 to Web3. [NEAR University](https://www.near.university/) creates a space where everyone interested in acquiring the skills needed to start building on NEAR can do so by following different training paths. The courses provided by NEAR University are targeted to train the new generation of Web3 entrepreneurs, developers, analysts, UX designers, and educators.

Through training and mentorship, these courses equip  them with the knowledge and tools to kickstart their own projects and contribute to the making of Web3. These courses have been highly effective in bringing new people into the NEAR ecosystem and orienting them towards the best opportunities that the space can offer. In addition to instituting the NEAR University, NEAR Education has also encouraged the creation of regional educational hubs to increase its reach and attract talent from all over the world. NEAR Hispano is one such regional hub focused on the onboarding and mentoring of local talent and the pioneer of a new model for building thriving educational businesses. As blockchain technology and the concept of an open Web haven’t yet reached mass appeal, such initiatives are crucial to attracting entrepreneurs, developers, and ultimately users into NEAR Protocol.

## Why This Guide?

This guide is a valuable resource that gathers all the information and insights from an in depth case study of one of the most successful NEAR educational hubs. Designed to be simple and informative, this guide will provide its readers with a clear picture of the steps required to create a Web3 educational hub to foster innovation and talent in their region. Starting with a thorough introduction of NEAR Hispano highlighting its business model and value proposition,  the guide will proceed to break down the several stages that preceded the launch of NEAR Hispano, the strategies put in place to promote the project, as well as an overview of the result achieved.

Lastly, the guide will put forward nine key takeaways from our case study that will help entrepreneurs replicate NEAR Hispano’s success. The key points will be followed by a critical assessment of the variables that should be taken into account when building an educational community and by a section outlining NEAR general resources.
